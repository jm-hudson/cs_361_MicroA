What is the current status of the microservice? Hopefully, it’s done!

If the microservice isn’t done, which parts aren’t done and when will they be done?
N/A
How is your teammate going to access your microservice? Should they get your code from GitHub (if so, provide a link to your public or private repo)? Should they run your code locally? Is your microservice hosted somewhere? Etc.
- Code is hosted locally
If your teammate cannot access/call YOUR microservice, what should they do? Can you be available to help them? What’s your availability?
- Contact through Discord, email, or text
If your teammate cannot access/call your microservice, by when do they need to tell you?
- Earliest convenience
Is there anything else your teammate needs to know? Anything you’re worried about? Any assumptions you’re making? Any other mitigations / backup plans you want to mention or want to discuss with your teammate?
- Let me know about any additional questions.
